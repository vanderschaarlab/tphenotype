# T-Phenotype: Discovering Phenotypes of Predictive Temporal Patterns in Disease Progression (AISTATS2023)

Source code for the T-Phenotype approach proposed in paper "T-Phenotype: Discovering Phenotypes of Predictive Temporal Patterns in Disease Progression"

## Installation & Environment Setup

To run the experiments, directly clone this repository via the following command.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:yvchao/tphenotype.git
```

Ensure you have [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) installed in your environment and run the installation script **setup_venv.sh**.
```bash
bash ./setup_venv.sh
```
This will install the **tphenotype** package along with necessary dependencies to reproduce the experiment results.
A jupyter lab instance will be started, and the **notebooks** directory will be opened in your browser.



## Datasets

Three datasets are used in the experiment.
- Synthetic data: provided in this repo as **data_mixed.npz**; can be generated by running data/synthetic/data_generation.ipynb.
- [Physionet ICU](https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2012/1.0.0/) data: publicly available at PhysioNet.
- [ADNI](https://tadpole.grand-challenge.org/) data: can be downloaded from [loni](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/).

## Experiments
There are three major parts of the experiment.
- benchmark: run the summary.ipynb to generate benchmark results on the three datasets.
- case_study: run experiment_adni.ipynb to generate the major results in the main manuscript.
- appendix: run the four notebooks to generate all the rest results included in the appendix.

All reported results in notebooks are generated with Python environment installed through pyenv 2.3.13. 
The the experiment machine has Linux kernel 6.1.12 and GCC 12.2.1 installed.
Consider setting CPU affinity via e.g. `taskset --cpu-list 0-2` if some results cannot be reproduced identically.
